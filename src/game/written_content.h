"This new treatment uses a combination of coconut oil and honey. The results are\n"
"astounding. Researchers say, \"We don't know much but it works.\" Radha Subramanian,\n"
"the lead researcher comments, \"My mother always told me about the power of coconut.\n"
"Now the world has started realising.\"\n"
"\n"
"Radha and her team has shown the world that coconuts and bees together have a\n"
"power that is unmatched. This treatment seems ineffective at first but the devil\n"
"is in the details.\n"
"\n"
"The coconut oil helps in keeping your hair moist, but it also makes the roots of the\n"
"hair slippery. However, the head is powerful enough to grab on to the hair strongly.\n"
"But the magic starts when you mix it with honey. The honey gives strength to your\n"
"hair so they can be free from the ties of the head. Once the hair falls out, the honey\n"
"settles into the scalp, hence preventing further growth of hair.\n"
"\n"
"Many people including some researchers have tried the method themselves and have\n"
"proved all the skeptics wrong. \"I would have never believed this till I saw my husband\n"
"come back with no hair!\", said Sujata, a housewife. \"At first I thought it was a wig.\",\n"
"said Jyotsna after seeing her friend bald for the first time.\n"
"\n"
"This miracle not only works on your head but your entire body. Use this remedy today to\n"
"get a flawless hairless body.\n"
