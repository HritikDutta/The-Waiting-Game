# Loading Screen Game

Your office PC is really slow. To load the project it takes about N seconds. But the computer is filled
with junk and bloatware. Every new window slows down the loading process significantly.

          NEW TREATMENT FOR HAIRLOSS!!!
      YOU WILL NEVER BELIEVE TILL YOU READ THIS
        - Richa Peshwa, 27th October 2031

    "Wow! I've never lost so much hair in my entire life!!" - Himesh, Accountant

    This new treatment uses a combination of coconut oil and honey. The results are
    astounding. Researchers say, "We don't know much but it works." Radha Subramanian,
    the lead researcher comments, "My mother always told me about the power of coconut.
    Now the world has started realising."

    Radha and her team has shown the world that coconuts and bees together have a
    power that is unmatched. This treatment seems ineffective at first but the devil
    is in the details.

    The coconut oil helps in keeping your hair moist, but it also makes the roots of the
    hair slippery. However, the head is powerful enough to grab on to the hair strongly.
    But the magic starts when you mix it with honey. The honey gives strength to your
    hair so they can be free from the ties of the head. Once the hair falls out, the honey
    settles into the scalp, hence preventing further growth of hair.

    Many people including some researchers have tried the method themselves and have
    proved all the skeptics wrong. "I would have never believed this till I saw my husband
    come back with no hair!", said Sujata, a housewife. "At first I thought it was a wig.",
    said Jyotsna after seeing her friend bald for the first time.

    This miracle not only works on your head but your entire body. Use this remedy today to
    get a flawless hairless body.
